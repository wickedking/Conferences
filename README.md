Conferences
===========

Program for a conference to receive review papers submitted. handles multiple conferences and job levels. 
Requires a database to be setup on the local machine with specific tables and names.
Database is setup to use blobs. If using in production would need to redo data scheme with a better design.

Note: Not the most effective use of a database. Was created when we had very little experience with databases. To make good use of a database would require a major refactor.
